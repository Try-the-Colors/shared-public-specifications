# Product feed specification

The specification of the product feed that we need to be able to display your colors in our application.
It is based on the specification for Heureka, and is fully compatible with it. So you don't have to create a new feed.

I recommend adding the described optional parameters as well. Your customer will then choose the product more easily and there will be better conversions.

`Param' tags will then also be visible directly on your Heureka, which means that your customers will be able to filter products better there as well.

If you have an already created product feed in a different specification, get in touch and we can take a look at it.
